# React, Web3.0 Crowdfunding-Platform (Variant 2)

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ctZmDRy/Explainer-Frame-min.png">
The next-gen crowdfunding platform. Made with React, Solidity Smart Contracts, and ThirdWeb - This simple crowdfunding application allows users to back projects through the Blockchain and Ethereum.<br>
<br>
The flow is simple. A user connects their MetaMask wallet, then can create a campaign. Campaigns then can be backed by other users, using their wallet and Ethereum.

### Client Technologies Used
- ThirdWeb / Ethers - Connectivity between Thirdweb smart contracts and MetaMask wallet<br>
- React - Client side rendering UI and components<br>
- ReactDOM - provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app<br>
- React-Router-DOM - Handles the routing and paths for pages<br>
- ViteJS - the default project management system for building the application<br>
- AutoPrefixer - CSS parser and vendor CSS management<br>
- PostCSS - CSS minification and orginization<br>
- TailwindCSS - Frontend CSS service<br>

### Web3 Technologies Used
- Hardhat - Ethereum development environment. Compile your contracts and run them on a development network<br>
- DotENV - Handles the system environment variables<br>

### Future Improvements
- Better user-authentication methods. Implimentation of a user-account model before the connection of MetaMask.
- Payment withdrawl functionality. Once users' have completed a campaign, the withdrawl of funds to their PayPal / Bank account.
- Campaign list sorting. Ability to view by date, and their highest and lowest funding totals.
- Better user profiles. With more customization options and personality.

### Things That Kicked My Boo-tay
- Handling the Solidity contract was majority of the brainache I received. I'm still navigating Solidity, and have a long way to go in order to fully understand it.
- Handling the page routing was another pain in the ***. While they function, a re-write of the routing situation is going to happen down the line.
