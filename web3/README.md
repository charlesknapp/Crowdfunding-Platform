### address
Solidity actually offers two address value types: address and address payable. <br>
The difference between the two is that address payable can send and transfer Ether. <br>

### uint256
Value data type that must be non-negative. (greater than or equal to zero) <br>
Just like signed integers, this value data type takes up to 32B by default. <br>


### String memory 
Strings in Solidity is a reference type of data type which stores the location of <br>
the data instead of directly storing the data into the variable. <br>

They are dynamic arrays that store a set of characters that can consist of numbers, <br>
special characters, spaces, and alphabets. <br>

### mapping
Mappings are mostly used to associate the unique Ethereum address with the <br>
associated value type. <br>
